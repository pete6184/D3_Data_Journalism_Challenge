          <h3>Correlations Discovered Between Poverty Levels and Population Without Healthcare</h3>
          <hr>
          <p>Imagine having to choose between eating or having health care. Unfortunately, that is 
          the reality for many residents these days.  Recent studies reveal that in states where poverty 
          levels are higher there is a larger percentage of residents who do not have healthcare.
          </p>

          <p>In the study conducted by the University of Oregon's Data Analytics Cohort there was a direct
            correlation found between a state's population living in poverty and the amount of the same
            population who did not currently have healthcare.
          </p>
          <p>
            Did we mention there is a correlation between a state's population who is living in poverty
            and the percentage of the population without Healthcare?
          </p>

          <p>Residents nationwide were left stunned. Local resident, Karl Pearson was interviewed regarding
            the study. The only comment the stunned resident was able to mutter was,
            "Ummm, yeah......that kinda seems like common sense; no? Plus this graph I made (pictured above) shows a
            strong correlation between the poverty rate and the population without healthcare."</p>
